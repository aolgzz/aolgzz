  <div>About me:</div>
</h2>

<p align = "justify">My name is <b>Arturo Olivares</b>, I am a <b>Computer Science student</b> at <b>Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (ITESM)</b>. Over the last two years I have been involved in learning a wide variety of subjects which are but not limited to algorithms, data structures, programming languages, data analysis, among others.</p>
<p align="justify">My biggest interests are data analysis, mainly with <b>Python</b>/Jupyter Notebook and libraries such as <b>NumPy</b>, and <b>Matplotlib</b> (I have tried the R programming language, and statistical software like Tableau, and Minitab, but they were not to my liking), the study of the development of a programming language that goes from the purpose for which it was created, its paradigm, its way of translation, also computational methods used for its creation (regular expressions, lexers, parsers, etc.), and finally the design and implementation of customized data structures, and algorithms. I could also say I'm a huge <b>C++</b> enjoyer (until I have to use pointers, and memory management).</p>

<p align = "justify">Currently, I am on a quest to expand my arsenal by learning new languages, and frameworks. Right now in my career program we are being taught the <b>Racket</b>, <b>Clojure</b>, and <b>Prolog</b> programming languages, and on my own I'm learning <b>Elixir</b>, <b>Ruby</b>, and <b>Go</b>. Regarding frameworks, one of my recent interests is web development and I'm looking for the right framework for it; my candidates are <b>Ruby on Rails</b> (Ruby), <b>Gin</b> (Go), and <b>Phoenix</b> (Elixir). It is worth mention that I am also interested in learning <b>React</b> for frontend development.</p>

<p align = "justify">Feel free to look around my repository, I'll be uploading some of my personal projects here. Any feedback is always welcome.</p>
